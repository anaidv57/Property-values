The dataset includes information about the house sales in the city of Northampton in Massachusetts situated in the United States. A train route used to be in this city, but this suspended all its services in 1960. In 1984, part of the railway was converted to a multi-use track (for cycling, walking and running). There is a study about the association between rail trails and property values, which was conducted by Hartenian and Horton (2015). The dataset used offer house information about square footage, acre, number of bedrooms and other.
